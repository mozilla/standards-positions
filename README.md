# Mozilla's Positions on Emerging Web Specifications

_See [the dashboard](https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/) for Mozilla's current positions._

## What is this Repository?

This repo is where [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org/) decides and documents what it thinks about
emerging technical specifications for the Web. Typically such specs are standards-track drafts in the
[IETF](https://ietf.org/), [W3C](https://w3.org/),
[WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/), and [Ecma TC39](https://github.com/tc39).
We may also provide positions on documents located outside a standards process, 
e.g. those in W3C Community Groups such as [WICG](https://wicg.github.io/) 
or other community incubation efforts with well-understood
<abbr title="intellectual property rights">IPR</abbr> terms, 
but as a general rule believe that any such work must be moved to a formal standards track 
before it’s appropriate for adoption as part of the web platform.

Having a clear Mozilla position on these specifications helps us align our thinking and communicate
it clearly to these standards bodies, as well as other browsers.

Implementation status (or even intention) isn't tracked here; see [dev-platform](https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-platform/).

### Possible Specification Positions

We will seek to apply one of three labels to new specifications:

- `positive` - Mozilla regards this work as a potential improvement to the web.
- `neutral` - Mozilla is not convinced of the merits of this work, but does not see any significant negative potential.
- `negative` - Mozilla believes that pursuing this work in its current form would not be good for the web.

These positions will be based on our best assessment of the current state of the specification and
the potential for it to benefit our users and the web as a whole.  We consider the intended purpose
and the design fundamentals of each specification.  Incomplete documentation, minor issues, or lack of
interoperability testing are not reasons for a negative position, provided that intent is clear.

We might also use the following labels for specifications where we have not formed a position:

- `defer` - Mozilla takes no position on this work.
- `under consideration` - Mozilla has not taken a position on this work and is gathering more information.

### What about Firefox?

A position here does not address whether Mozilla will commit resources to developing a
specification. In particular, taking a position does not commit Mozilla to implementing a
specification in Firefox.
