# Mozilla's Positions on Emerging Web Specifications

_See [the dashboard](https://mozilla.github.io/standards-positions/) for Mozilla's current positions._

## What is this Repository?

**This is now a _pilot_ of a process for Mozilla to decide and document what it thinks about emerging technical specifications for the Web (see below).  We are currently trying this process on a small number of specifications, so we can see how it works and make adjustments as needed before putting it in wider use.**

This repo is where [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org/) decides and documents what it thinks about
emerging technical specifications for the Web. Typically they're draft documents in the
[IETF](https://ietf.org/), [W3C](https://w3.org/) (including the [WICG](https://wicg.github.io/)),
[WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/), and [Ecma TC39](https://github.com/tc39), but they could come from
elsewhere too.

Having a clear Mozilla position on these specifications helps us align our thinking and communicate
it clearly to these standards bodies, as well as other browsers.

*See our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about how you can participate.*

Implementation status (or even intention) isn't tracked here; see [Firefox Platform Status](https://platform-status.mozilla.org).

### Possible Specification Positions

The currently possible positions are:

- `under consideration` - Mozilla's position on this specification is being discussed.
- `important` - This specification is conceptually good and is important to Mozilla.
- `worth prototyping` - Mozilla sees this specification as conceptually good, and worth prototyping, getting feedback on its value, and iterating.
- `non-harmful` - Mozilla does not see this specification as harmful, but is not convinced that it is a good approach or worth working on.
- `defer` - Mozilla does not intend to look at this specification at all in the near future.
- `harmful` - Mozilla considers this specification to be harmful in its current state.

Note that these positions do not address whether Mozilla will commit resources to a specification,
nor does it commit Mozilla to implementing them.
