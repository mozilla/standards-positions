    "description": "This document describes a common data model and API for the Web of Things. The Web Thing Description provides a vocabulary for describing physical devices connected to the World Wide Web in a machine readable format with a default JSON encoding. The Web Thing REST API and Web Thing WebSocket API allow a web client to access the properties of devices, request the execution of actions and subscribe to events representing a change in state. Some basic Web Thing Types are provided and additional types can be defined using semantic extensions with JSON-LD. In addition to this specification there is a note on Web Thing API Protocol Bindings which proposes non-normative bindings of the Web Thing API to various existing IoT protocols. There is also a document describing Web of Things Integration Patterns which provides advice on different design patterns for integrating connected devices with the Web of Things, and where each pattern is most appropriate.",
