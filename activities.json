These signatures can be verified against an origin's certificate to establish that the exchange is authoritative for an origin even if it was transferred over a connection that isn't. The signatures can also be used in other ways described in the appendices. These signatures contain countermeasures against downgrade and protocol-confusion attacks.",

Specifically, the ability for an origin to act on behalf of another without a client ever contacting the authoritative server is worrisome, as is the removal of a guarantee of confidentiality from the web security model (the host serving the web package has access to plain text). We recognise that the use cases satisfied by web packaging are useful, and would be likely to support an approach that enabled such use cases so long as the foregoing concerns could be addressed.",

The Web Thing Description provides a vocabulary for describing physical devices connected to the World Wide Web in a machine readable format with a default JSON encoding. The Web Thing REST API and Web Thing WebSocket API allow a web client to access the properties of devices, request the execution of actions and subscribe to events representing a change in state. Some basic Web Thing Types are provided and additional types can be defined using semantic extensions with JSON-LD. In addition to this specification there is a note on Web Thing API Protocol Bindings which proposes non-normative bindings of the Web Thing API to various existing IoT protocols. There is also a document describing Web of Things Integration Patterns which provides advice on different design patterns for integrating connected devices with the Web of Things, and where each pattern is most appropriate.",

Having the control also makes it easier for future specifications to be designed so that this behavior is the default, but can be overridden in the other direction to allow the subframe to use the feature.  The control provided by this specification also allows sites to exercise CSP-like control over their own content's use of these features.",
