They also enable aliasing of apex domains, which is not possible with CNAME. The HTTPSSVC DNS RR is a variation of SVCB for HTTPS and HTTP origins. By providing more information to the client before it attempts to establish a connection, these records offer potential benefits to both performance and privacy.  TO BE REMOVED: This proposal is inspired by and based on recent DNS usage proposals such as ALTSVC, ANAME, and ESNIKEYS (as well as long standing desires to have SRV or a functional equivalent implemented for HTTP). These proposals each provide an important function but are potentially incompatible with each other, such as when an origin is load-balanced across multiple hosting providers (multi-CDN). Furthermore, these each add potential cases for adding additional record lookups in-addition to AAAA/A lookups. This design attempts to provide a unified framework that encompasses the key functionality of these proposals, as well as providing some extensibility for addressing similar future challenges.

    "description": "This specification defines an API that allows websites to declare themselves asweb share targets, which can receive shared content from either the Web Share API, or system events (e.g., shares from native apps).This is a similar mechanism to navigator.registerProtocolHandler, in that it works by registering the website with the user agent, to later be invoked from another site or native application via the user agent (possibly at the discretion of the user). The difference is that registerProtocolHandler registers the handler via a programmatic API, whereas a Web Share Target is declared in the Web App Manifest, to be registered at a time of the user agent or user's choosing.",

The Web Thing Description provides a vocabulary for describing physical devices connected to the World Wide Web in a machine readable format with a default JSON encoding. The Web Thing REST API and Web Thing WebSocket API allow a web client to access the properties of devices, request the execution of actions and subscribe to events representing a change in state. Some basic Web Thing Types are provided and additional types can be defined using semantic extensions with JSON-LD. In addition to this specification there is a note on Web Thing API Protocol Bindings which proposes non-normative bindings of the Web Thing API to various existing IoT protocols. There is also a document describing Web of Things Integration Patterns which provides advice on different design patterns for integrating connected devices with the Web of Things, and where each pattern is most appropriate.",

    "mozPositionDetail": "Because many USB devices are not designed to handle potentially-malicious interactions over the USB protocols and because those devices can have significant effects on the computer they're connected to, we believe that the security risks of exposing USB devices to the Web are too broad to risk exposing users to them or to explain properly to end users to obtain meaningful informed consent. It also poses risks that sites could use USB device identity or data stored on USB devices as tracking identifiers.",
