We would prefer to progressively freeze the value of User-Agent HTTP header without replacement. We acknowledge the performance trade-offs this might introduce, but note that the performance characteristics of the proposed design are unclear and optimized almost exclusively for the very first connection to a site. The overheads involved add further uncertainty about performance as three new header fields are sent in every HTTPS request, plus fields for any information a site requests using the Accept-CH mechanism. Adding fields makes it more likely that server-side limits on fields are exceeded, which - even if it is not be a problem now - future specifications might be affected. Any benefit to edge caches from the use of the Vary mechanism on the new headers is not realized unless all clients send these new headers. For caching, we would prefer to explore other options that do not rely on all clients sending the new fields.
